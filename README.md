# VisageSeek: Web-based Computer Vision Image Classification

## Introduction

VisageSeek is a web application that leverages computer vision techniques to classify images. This project provides a user-friendly interface for uploading and classifying images using a trained machine learning model.

## Features

Image Upload: Upload images for classification.
Real-time Results: Get classification results displayed on the web page.
Machine Learning Integration: Utilize a pre-trained model for accurate image classification.
Getting Started

## Prerequisites:

Python 3.x (https://www.python.org/downloads/)
Necessary libraries (see Dependencies section below)
Basic understanding of web development concepts, including Flask and HTML

## Installation:

Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/dilbersha/VisageSeek-cv-image-classification-web.git
```
Navigate to the project directory:
```
cd VisageSeek-cv-image-classification-web
```
Install required dependencies:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt  # Replace with the actual command if using a different requirements file
```

Run the Application:

Start the Flask development server:
```
python app.py
```
Access the application in your web browser, typically at http://127.0.0.1:5000/ (replace with the port specified in app.py if different).

## Dependencies

Flask (web framework)
Additional libraries required for computer vision tasks (e.g., OpenCV, TensorFlow, PyTorch) - Specify these in a requirements.txt file
Usage

Visit the application URL in your web browser.
Click the "Choose File" button or drag and drop an image onto the designated area.
The application will process the image and display the classification results on the screen.

## Example Output
```
Image classified as: <Category Name> (Confidence Score: <Value>)
```
## Further Development

Enhance the user interface for a more interactive experience.
Integrate with a cloud platform for scalability and deployment.
Experiment with different pre-trained models or train your own for specific classification tasks.
